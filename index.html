	<h2>Blog about Xmas</h2>
	<p>During the year, there are many festivals held. One of the most anticipated festivals of the year was Christmas. This holiday is usually celebrated on December 25 every year. During Christmas, people communicate with each other with the most intimate gestures and words. This shows courtesy. People always believe that this makes life a happier and happier life. During Christmas, people decorate the Christmas tree and their houses beautifully.Each person, each family will celebrate different Christmas activities. There are those who like to walk on the beautifully decorated streets. Someone likes to go shopping. Many families celebrate this holiday with great food. Gifts are given to each other with sweet wishes. Although Christmas is a bit cold, everyone feels warm and extremely happy. I really love this holiday.</p>
